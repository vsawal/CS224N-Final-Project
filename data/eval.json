The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763?","id":"0e6b64edaeab88a3bee8d3ec8","answers":[{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22},{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22},{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22},{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22},{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the objective of Royal Proclamation of 1763?","id":"f4daf208e16569b7a41bfd4fe","answers":[{"text":"outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory","answer_start":102},{"text":"outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory","answer_start":102},{"text":"division and administration of the newly conquered territory","answer_start":115},{"text":"division and administration","answer_start":115},{"text":"the division and administration of the newly conquered territory","answer_start":111}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What lands were reserved for natives?","id":"5ea6b98e9b1febbfdef7d2b6c","answers":[{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345},{"text":"lands west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":339},{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345},{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345},{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22}],"question":"Who never issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763?","id":"3f5ac6bf9df7d2976c9f4f65d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"King George III","answer_start":22}],"question":"Who issued the Royal Proclamation of 1736?","id":"45cff5cf37a57acaedfeba7db","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory","answer_start":102}],"question":"What was the objective of Royal Proclamation of 1736?","id":"b40c4cdcddcdaaeb853874bf9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345}],"question":"What lands weren't reserved for natives?","id":"6e0d0e48d23f0ea5cbebaa4bf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"west of the Appalachian Mountains","answer_start":345}],"question":"What lands were reserved for the French?","id":"9216715089734f26845fea0b1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Following the treaty, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations.

The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution."},{"qas":[{"question":"What did the loss mean to France?","id":"8e5a9efd3c01aebe4df2d39d7","answers":[{"text":"disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession","answer_start":88},{"text":"disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion","answer_start":88},{"text":"elimination of French power","answer_start":33},{"text":".","answer_start":985}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What made Ohio Country vulnerable?","id":"e8b177b6364f3edd7f71bb6f0","answers":[{"text":"military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes","answer_start":304},{"text":"construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes","answer_start":288},{"text":"the construction of military roads to the area","answer_start":284},{"text":"military roads to the area","answer_start":304},{"text":"the construction of military roads","answer_start":284}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory complete?","id":"c3171ebb8e1c68691ee0ea1da","answers":[{"text":"1769","answer_start":443},{"text":"1769","answer_start":443},{"text":"1769","answer_start":443},{"text":"1769","answer_start":443},{"text":"1769","answer_start":443}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What natives were displaced by British takeover in Florida?","id":"e92da6ee8ae4c3ec2a01d3ff4","answers":[{"text":"Choctaw and the Creek","answer_start":646},{"text":"tribes that did not want to do business with the British","answer_start":553},{"text":"Choctaw and the Creek","answer_start":646},{"text":"Choctaw and the Creek","answer_start":646}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where did many Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?","id":"3abcbd2deeab1fd03b875e19f","answers":[{"text":"Most went to Cuba,","answer_start":831},{"text":"Most went to Cuba","answer_start":831},{"text":"Cuba","answer_start":844},{"text":"Cuba","answer_start":844},{"text":"Cuba","answer_start":844}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Most went to Cuba","answer_start":831}],"question":"Where did no Spanish Catholic move after British takeover in Florida?","id":"df96ef0ea14d3ee4a86dc81dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes","answer_start":304}],"question":"What made Ohio Country safe?","id":"1acb64661dbe8afa6b2c81ece","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1769","answer_start":443}],"question":"When was Spanish takeover of Louisiana Territory incomplete?","id":"1b613c7a5ad8e383a8def7b52","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Choctaw and the Creek","answer_start":646}],"question":"What natives were displaced by British takeover in Georgia?","id":"a2e0b693fcbb941561be4ce7e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession","answer_start":88}],"question":"What did the win mean to France?","id":"5d9a80e098ad0faccdfc04fe1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"For many native populations, the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion, leading to their ultimate dispossession.

Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia."},{"qas":[{"question":"What has partical physics made to describe sub-atomic forces?","id":"f3eed5fba0d67eaadcd3ece22","answers":[{"text":"Standard Model","answer_start":149},{"text":"Standard Model","answer_start":149},{"text":"Standard Model","answer_start":149},{"text":"Standard Model","answer_start":149},{"text":"a Standard Model","answer_start":147},{"text":"a Standard Model","answer_start":147}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the exchanged particles predicted by the standard Model?","id":"1b565ef86efae8e6b7da8b2ad","answers":[{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281},{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281},{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281},{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281},{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281},{"text":"gauge bosons","answer_start":281}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the strongest main interaction?","id":"fda6cddc7e4c4afce481d4f75","answers":[{"text":"strong","answer_start":444},{"text":"strong","answer_start":444},{"text":"strong,","answer_start":444},{"text":"strong","answer_start":444},{"text":"strong","answer_start":444},{"text":"strong, electromagnetic","answer_start":444}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the weakest main interaction?","id":"c537dc6dfe596c58fe8ba3e8e","answers":[{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479},{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479},{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479},{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479},{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479},{"text":"gravitational","answer_start":479}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are weak and electromatic forces expressions of?","id":"e4c5cd733604e47c5427811d7","answers":[{"text":"electroweak interaction","answer_start":665},{"text":"a more fundamental electroweak interaction","answer_start":646},{"text":"more fundamental electroweak interaction.","answer_start":648},{"text":"a more fundamental electroweak interaction","answer_start":646},{"text":"fundamental electroweak interaction.","answer_start":653}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"quantum mechanics and technology","answer_start":26}],"question":"What can decelerate particles close to the speed of light?","id":"9f93ccb698fa35cfbba5dfede","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"forces between particles smaller than atoms","answer_start":176}],"question":"Particle physics has created a Unique Model to describe what?

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows.

This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia.

Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two."},{"qas":[{"question":"What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?","id":"aa2e4ddddeaf11acbeadef8b4","answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"friction","answer_start":154},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":119}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is generated between a surface and an object that is being pushed?","id":"fc2a895a9747aaceceda7eee9","answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147},{"text":"static friction","answer_start":147}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Static friction balances what force when there is no movement of an object on a surface?","id":"ba498a4f1d9d7d024c628b0ab","answers":[{"text":"applied","answer_start":297},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":119},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":297},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":297},{"text":"applied","answer_start":297}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What makes static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?","id":"aaec474db92fbfb40171b35ec","answers":[{"text":"applied force","answer_start":403},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":403},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":403},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":403},{"text":"applied force","answer_start":403}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a situation where the object does not move","answer_start":64}],"question":"Pulling on an object on a frictional surface can result in what?","id":"ae7fca39effbaea1f56b9c06e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pushing against an object on a frictional surface","answer_start":0}],"question":"When will an object move because the applied force is opposed by static friction?","id":"61cf831d79b2f6b0f828bde6b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":345}],"question":"What increases or decreases in response to applied friction?","id":"8dffd3005dbe94c8a2efbb11a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"static friction","answer_start":345}],"question":"What increases or decreases in response to static friction?","id":"5e7fc6a6b935de7c4f7ca1bcc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.

This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.

This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.

In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.

From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).

Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the repulsive force of close range atom interaction?","id":"3ebb8eedabe1f0ca0dc3ba2b0","answers":[{"text":"normal force","answer_start":4},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":4},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":4},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What occurs when electron clouds overlap from different atoms?","id":"d84edf5ef0ff77fea5b2d714b","answers":[{"text":"Pauli repulsion","answer_start":127},{"text":"Pauli repulsion","answer_start":127},{"text":"Pauli repulsion","answer_start":127},{"text":"Pauli repulsion","answer_start":127}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What causes Pauli repulsion?","id":"f24e3f07e218b2ffbed0801a0","answers":[{"text":"fermionic nature of electrons","answer_start":151},{"text":"fermionic nature of electrons","answer_start":151},{"text":"fermionic nature of electrons","answer_start":151},{"text":"fermionic nature of electrons","answer_start":151}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the force that causes rigid strength in structures?","id":"2e45ce57a1ccdf03cae0b10be","answers":[{"text":"normal","answer_start":298},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":298},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":298},{"text":"normal force","answer_start":298}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"normal","answer_start":4}],"question":"What force is due to attractive forces of interaction?","id":"cdb582e442d4aa8afbf97ccda","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Pauli","answer_start":127}],"question":"What repulsion follows when atomic clouds overlap?","id":"a11b7df7ebafd29d9efbb4ff5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface","answer_start":528}],"question":"What is an example of the abnormal force in action?","id":"e8dec27e9d95b679864b14f19","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"tables and floors","answer_start":372}],"question":"The abnormal force is responsible for the structural integrity of what?","id":"4d1dadcb6ce23266f3a61cafa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.

The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque.
